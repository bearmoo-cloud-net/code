These are old python code that I'ved created.

rancher-api-main.py will return a list of hosts from rancher api. Usage:
rancher-api-main.py -a <access key> -s <secret key> -r <rancher 2.x host>

inputoutput.py is a sample python function that can be used to supply the script with arguments.

rancher-api-getContainers.py will get a list of containers running in the cluster.
